This is a repository I created to accompany my viewing of [React for Beginners](https://github.com/wesbos/React-For-Beginners-Starter-Files).

## Starting the project on your local computer

Before running the app, please configure your "Firebase Realtime Database" in [base.js](https://github.com/andregmoeller/catch-of-the-day/blob/master/src/base.js). Then please run `npm run dev` to start the project. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
